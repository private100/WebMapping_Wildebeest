          <h4>2015.05.20 2 hours</h4>
          <p>
              We had a discussion this day and finally decided the main topic of our web map: wildebeests’ migration in Africa,
              which I have come up with for a long time.
          </p>
          <h4>2015.06.02 2 hours</h4>
          <p>
              We had another discussion about the layout of the map. And Shuoyan came up with the design idea about the main map
              and Chiyuan mentioned that we should have 3 pages. I was responsible for the base map drawing task first.
          </p>
          <h4>2015.06.03 3 hours</h4>
          <p>
              I searched relevant materials: text and images, and download them with writing the attribution information in en text file.
          </p>
          <h4>2015.06.04 4 hours</h4>
          <p>
              I used the illustrator to draw the base map according to the reference I found, and made some changes to the design.
              I also drew the area where wildebeests are in different month.
          </p>
          <h4>2015.06.06 2 hours</h4>
          <p>
              I adjusted the color and the scale of the map to make it proper to be shown in the screen.
          </p>
          <h4>2015.06.07 4.5 hours</h4>
          <p>
              We had a discussion again to keep everything in order. Then I began to design the second page, the overview page.
              I cited the SVG elements from Shuoyan and added the second map, using Google API, to add some interactive part into
              our map. Then I added the navigation bar to the page with some responsive functions when the window is very small
              or narrow, especially in some mobile terminals.
          </p>
          <h4>2015.06.11 4 hours</h4>
          <p>
              There was some problem about the base map on different screens, so I had to rescale the base map and drew more about
              the background area. After this, I searched and downloaded relevant pictures for the main page’s information box, 
              according to different months.
          </p>
          <h4>2015.06.12 2 hours</h4>
          <p>
              I did the interactive part about the navigation part of all pages. I learned knowledge from other website to learn
              how others do this. Then I modified the navigation part to only show it in the very beginning, and if you scroll down,
              the navigation bar will be hidden.
          </p>

          
          
          <h3 class="diary">Chiyuan Gu's Diary</h3>
          <h4>2015/6/2 (3h)</h4>
          <p>
              We discussed the design of layout and the type of map including interactivities and functionalities. After referring
              to some existing web map, we are going to use scroll to show the change of migration area according to different months. 
              So this map will look like a story map. Our web map contains 3 pages which are the main map page, overview introduction page
              and the project diary page. I am assigned the task about realize the interactivity.
          </p>
          <h4>2015/6/6 (8h)</h4>
          <p>
              I start to do my part. In order to realize the functionality, I choose to use <a href="https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr">skrollr</a>,
              a parallax scrolling JavaScript library. Using skrollr.min.js our map is able to move around the background map image and animate
              the movements of the animal activity areas on the map as the user scrolls down the page. 
              Firstly, I learn something about skrollr.min.js following the tutorials on the Internet. 
              Then I try to realize some basic effects when I scroll down the page. I create a draft web page which contains the
              background map and a text box. When I scroll down the text, you can see that background image can move and other images can change 
              their size and change color. 
          </p>
          <h4>2015/6/7 (2h)</h4>
          <p>
              I tell my members the difficulties I suffered from and exchange the suggestions about our map.
          </p>
          <h4>2015/6/8 (4h)</h4>
          <p>
              I get the image materials from my members and begin to fix them on the right position on the web page. Firstly,
              I just set the "top" "left" attributes. As a result, the image will move according to the size of my browser
              window. Then it takes me a lot of time to address this problem. Finally, I find use "margin-top" or "margin-left" 
              can fixed the image position.
          </p>
          <h4>2015/6/10 (4h)</h4>
          <p>
              Today's task is to adjust the position of each image. It is a tough task because I can only do it by manual. 
              For this part, I do a lot of repeat work which drives me crazy.
          </p>
          <h4>2015/6/12 (1h)</h4>
          <p>
              We work together to figure out some detailed problems of our map such as color, font and responsive design.
          </p>
          
          
          
          <h3 class="diary">Shuoyan Huang's Diary</h3>
          <h4>2015.06.02</h4>
          <p>
              Discussed the content and basic layout of the map and remaining pages. I was inspired by some story maps, especially
              <a href="http://www.vg.no/spesial/2014/spillet-om-norge/index_en.php">this one</a>, and told my team mates about the
              idea. Then we divided the work among us. Time spent: <strong>2 hours</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <h4>2015.06.07</h4>
          <p>
              Had a discussion with team mates, and draw the timeline in Illustrator. (But we decided later that the timeline is unnecessary...)
              Time spent: <strong>2 hours</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <h4>2015.06.11</h4>
          <p>
              Styled the text area and edited the text content to display the information month by month. 
              Studied the skrollr library and set data-attribute to (almost) synchronize the highlighted areas
              and corresponding text when scrolling.
              Added a consistent navigation bar to the website, overwrote the one done by Furui.
              Problem: the scrolling isn't smooth (long delay before displaying some area).
          </p>
          <p>
             Time spent: <strong>7 hours</strong>.  
          </p>
          
          <h4>2015.06.12</h4>
          <p>
              Made the navigation bar responsive. Set two break points: 840px and 640 px. 
              Added more content to the scrolling text area. Added image captions. 
              Added more content to and styled the "About" page.
              Collected everyone's diary and added the project diary page.
              <br>Time spent: <strong>8 hours</strong>.
          </p>
          <h4>2015.06.13</h4>
          <p>
              Adjusted the scrolling text description at the right hand side one last time to make sure they are aligned
              with the moving areas on the map. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Continued to work with the responsive aspect of the website, styled nav bar
              and content in different window sizes, and used jQuery to show/hide the dropdown menu at small screen size. 
              (unfortunately you have to click the menu again to hide the dropdown, not by clicking elsewhere.)
          </p>
          <p>
              Time spent: <strong>5 hours</strong>.
